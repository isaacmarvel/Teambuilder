# Teambuilder
This is a Blazor site users will be able use to create and store pokemon teams. As a stretch goal, users will be able to login via a username and password, but at the very least the site will communicate with the pokeapi(https://pokeapi.co/) to pull pokemon data, allowing users to use that data to create a team of six pokemon, including each pokemon's stats and moves, and each set of six will be saved to a sql database. 

Stretch goals: 
1. User authentication
2. The ability to edit teams one has already made. 
3. Create unit tests for the app

Code Louisville features included:
1. Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app
2. Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
3. Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
4. Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent
5. (Maybe) calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
6. (Maybe) create 3 or more unit tests for your application

next steps: add picture to pokemon, send them to database
